# Twilioapp

This is an SMS twilio app I made using nodejs. It uses the Twilio's SMS service to help you find current weather, currency rate, time, and restaurants 
of any places you would like. It uses multiple APIs for the service and is very simple to use. You simply text the Twilio's phone number anything to get started and
it will give you the instructions.
