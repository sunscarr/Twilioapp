# Twilioapp

This is an SMS twilio app I made using Node JS. It uses the Twilio's SMS service to  allow users to get the latest information of service requested, such as: weather and time of any places, currencies conversion, and details of movies and tv shows. It uses multiple APIs for the service and is very simple to use. You simply text the Twilio's phone number anything to get started and it will give you the instructions.
Here are so examples:
